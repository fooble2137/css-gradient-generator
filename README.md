# CSS Gradient Generator

A gradient generator built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This interactive tool allows users to easily create and customise CSS gradients. You can select and modify multiple colours, adjust their positions and alter the gradient's direction â€” whether linear, radial or angled. Once you are satisfied with your design, the generator automatically creates the corresponding CSS code that you can then copy and paste directly into your own web project. This makes it a useful tool for designers and developers who want to quickly experiment with visual styles and enhance the appearance of their websites or user interfaces.
